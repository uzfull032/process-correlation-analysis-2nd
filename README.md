correlation works: between simulation and empirical outcomes in modified chambers

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This study analyzes the correlation between coating thickness and flow variables in **modified FOWLP chambers.** Strong linear relationships were found between flow behaviors and coating uniformity, especially in hole-type designs. Slit chambers with baffles also showed improved correlation under stable pressure conditions. The results suggest that chamber geometry and flow control are key to process stability.
