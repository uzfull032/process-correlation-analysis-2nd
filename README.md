correlation works: between simulation and empirical outcomes in modified chambers

## üìÑ Abstract

This study explores the relationship between pressure distribution and wafer coating uniformity in modified FOWLP bake chambers. Using correlation coefficients and R¬≤ values, we analyzed how structural changes, including baffle installation and inlet type (hole, slit, plain), influence coating quality. Strong correlations were found under optimized conditions, highlighting the importance of pressure control and chamber design. The findings provide data-driven insights for process improvement in semiconductor packaging.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The analysis confirmed that **coating thickness variation is highly correlated with flow pressure metrics across modified chamber types**. In particular, *the slit + baffle + 0.05‚ÄØkPa configuration achieved the strongest correlation and coating consistency.* Structural modifications significantly influence the linearity of flow behavior. These results support the use of pressure-based control and design optimization to enhance wafer uniformity.
